# unit-4-game

This project is to allow me to practice my jquery skills when interacting with the DOM. It's meant to show proficiency on a few different areas in relation to how jquery can both interact, change and push information to the actual game itself. 

Basically each crystal has a set value that gets randomized every time a new game starts. Without seeing the value you need to use them to reach the goal number. when you win, its counted and the game resets, vice versa with a loss. 

I'll most likely go back and make this project a bit prettier when I have more time on my hands. As it stands at the moment it's a bit bland. Feel free to direct any questions to crhodes2146@gmail.com.
